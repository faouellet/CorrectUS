# CorrectUS
## Installation
To use CorrectUS, you'll need the following:
* Python 3.4
* clang-tidy
* PyQt5
* PyYAML

For Windows users, you can get the installers at the following addresses:
* Python 3.4: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* clang-tidy: http://llvm.org/builds/
* PyQt5: https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5

For PyYAML, you use `pip` to install it. So if you don't change the default location for Python 3, the command to run should be:
```bash
C:\Python34\Scripts\pip.exe install pyyaml
```
